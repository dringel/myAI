IBMax’s knowledge base includes **dozens of hand-curated markdown files** derived from industry-standard sources such as:

- Mergers & Inquisitions

- Vault & firm guides
- Intern-to-analyst coaching notes

## 🧪 How RAG Works in IBMax

1. User query → `IntentionModule` detects intent (e.g., "technical").
2. Query embedding → matched against Pinecone vector DB.
3. Matched chunks are **ranked by metadata category**.
4. Prompt is generated using top-ranked sources and passed to OpenAI.
5. Answer is returned with citations and injected into a conversational UI.
